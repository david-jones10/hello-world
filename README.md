# hello-world
Completing the Hello-World GitHub tutorial

I'm a young developer looking to extend my skills and portfolio. I hope to contribute to open-source projects, as well as sharing and developing my own projects.

I'm currently developing proffessionally in UniBasic on the UniData MultiValue platform. I am additionally responsible for a cross platform mobile application written using Xamarin in C#, although my responsibility so far has been in minor bug resolution rather than any major new development.

Thanks for reading!
